# Etch-a-Sketch

This Etch-a-Sketch app is a pixelated sketch board where users can draw anything they like. The grid is generated dynamically using **JavaScript** and **CSS Flexbox**, and users can customize the number of grids per side. The app also supports colorful drawing effect for repeated strokes.

## Features
- **Customizable grid**: Choose how many squares per side for your sketch board.
- **Colorful drawing**: Draw with a variety of colors.
- **Darkening effect**: Repeated strokes darken the colors for a shading effect.
